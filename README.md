2/14:

memo04: 1. Studying the objective is of vital importance...;
        2. The achetecture set-up is not successful;

2/13:
1. Finish programing standard procee

memo03: Programming is somehow like to compose an article or to create a story.

2/12:
1. Refine the model structure;
2. Refine the data structure.

memo02: Be careful of global variable. Besides, for simulink, try to use blocks ans signals as much as possible.

2/11:
1. General logics for calculator finished.
2. Basic functional component set up.

memo01: It is quite important to seperate the functional component and logic component. Thus, the modulour programming.
