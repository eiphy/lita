# Lita
This project focus on build the basic interpolator of Lita, the acceleartion ability, kinematic mapping ability.

2/12:
1. Refine the model structure;
2. Refine the data structure.

meom02: Be careful of global variable. Besides, for simulink, try to use blocks ans signals as much as possible.

2/11:
1. General logics for calculator finished.
2. Basic functional component set up.

memo01: It is quite important to seperate the functional component and logic component. Thus, the modulour programming.
