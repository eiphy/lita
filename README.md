This aims to develop an agile robot which has the movement intuition similar to animals, and is definitely a long-term project.

The first step of this project is to build a relative convincing simulation environment, currently it should be built in gazebo, and attempt to build a model-free controller using DRL to do the locomotion of the robot.
