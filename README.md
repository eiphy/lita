# Lita

This project aims to develop intuition for a robot-lita. 

The intellegnet topics may be involved, but is not the main focus of this project.

<<<<<<< basic_interpolator_build
4.13:
Accelerator finished and mannual mode finished.

3.30:
1. Finish dectetor;
2. Start debug.

3.25:
Supervisor is so ... Back to this project.
1. Finish the profile generator.
2. MATLAB is updated to 2019a, some systmatic files may be changed.

Move on to do the commands generate & the test app.

3/3:
Debug.

20/2:
Finished the Accelerator.
Project temporarily suspended, as I've been focused on supervisor control theory recently.
I'll continuously work on the test data for the interpolator, and design the structure of kinematics part.

15/2: 
1. Finish the velocity shortage.
2. Debug standard process.
3. General thought of DS.

memo05: 1. The concept of displacement is fasinating! And so do the vetor!
        2. No need of perfect of the first time, and enjoy the pleasure of modification.
        3. Decrease the time of hesitating, and just calculate or analysis the model if be traped into something.
        4. I need more patient to appreciate the process.

14/2:
1. Debug the standard process
2. Start the velocity shortage

memo04: 1. Studying the objective is of vital importance...;
        2. The achetecture set-up is not successful;

13/2:
1. Finish programing standard process

memo03: Programming is somehow like to compose an article or to create a story.

12/2:
1. Refine the model structure;
2. Refine the data structure.

memo02: Be careful of global variable. Besides, for simulink, try to use blocks ans signals as much as possible.

11/2:
1. General logics for calculator finished.
2. Basic functional component set up.

memo01: It is quite important to seperate the functional component and logic component. Thus, the modulour programming.
